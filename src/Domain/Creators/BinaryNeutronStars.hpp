 * \ingroup ComputationalDomainGroup
 *
 * \brief A domain for a binary of two filled (non-excised) objects, such as
 * two neutron stars.
 *
 * \details The object centers lie on the \f$x\f$-axis at \f$x_A\f$
 * (`CenterA`) and \f$x_B\f$ (`CenterB`), with \f$0 < x_A \le |x_B|\f$ and
 * \f$x_B < 0\f$. The domain has three layers, from the inside out:
 *
 * 1. **Cubed cylinders.** Four groups of five blocks each surround the
 *    \f$x\f$-axis out to `WedgeOuterRadius` (see `Bulge` below for the shape
 *    of their outer faces). From left to right, the groups (`BLeft`,
 *    `BRight`, `ALeft`, `ARight`) span \f$x\f$ in [`LeftmostX`, `CenterB`],
 *    [`CenterB`, 0], [0, `CenterA`], and [`CenterA`, `RightmostX`]. Each group
 *    has a central cube with half-width `WedgeInnerRadius`\f$/\sqrt{2}\f$ in
 *    \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ (so its edges lie at radius `WedgeInnerRadius` from
 *    the \f$x\f$-axis) and four deformed-cube wedges around it.
 * 2. **Cylinders.** A hollow cylinder surrounds each of the four cubed-cylinder
 *    groups, and a filled cylinder (with a ZernikeB2 cross-section) caps each
 *    end, at \f$x = \f$ `LeftmostX` and \f$x = \f$ `RightmostX`. The outer
 *    faces of these six blocks together form a sphere of radius
 *    `CylinderOuterRadius` centered at the origin.
 * 3. **Spherical shells.** One or more spherical shells (using a spherical
 *    harmonic basis in the angular directions) extend from
 *    `CylinderOuterRadius` to `OuterRadius`. The number of shells is set by
 *    `SphericalShellsRadialPartitioning`.
 *
 * The interfaces between the cubed cylinders and the cylinders, and between
 * the cylinders and the innermost spherical shell, are non-conforming.
 *
 * The `Bulge` option selects the maps for the deformed-cube wedges and the
 * hollow cylinders. When `false`, the wedges are extruded 2D wedges, so their
 * outer faces lie on a circular cylinder of radius `WedgeOuterRadius`. When
 * `true`, the wedges use FlatOffsetWedge maps whose outer faces lie on spheres
 * centered on each object. The sphere around object B has radius
 * `WedgeOuterRadius`, and the radius of the sphere around object A is chosen
 * so that the two spheres meet the \f$x = 0\f$ plane in the same circle.
 *
 * Time-dependent maps (expansion, rotation, and translation) are supported
 * through `TimeDependentMaps`. Shape maps are not supported, because there are
 * no excision surfaces. As in BinaryCompactObject, the maps move all blocks
 * inside `CylinderOuterRadius` rigidly and transition across the spherical
 * shells out to `OuterRadius`.
